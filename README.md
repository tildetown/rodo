# rodo
A command-line todo list in Racket

**Currently under development**

You can try it out while it's being developed (**note: it requires that you have Racket installed**):

`./rodo init` -> initialize rodo in your home directory by default

`./rodo add milk` -> add "milk" to the list

`./rodo add "go to the bank"` -> add "go to the bank" to the list

`./rodo ls` -> list your todo list items
